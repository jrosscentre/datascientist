<h1>
inner join command
</h1>

<p>
the inner join function is a selector that draws from multiple tables so that you can relate data between tables. When using sql, you can display specified data from a master table. When there are different tables with a common column, the inner join function can take the colmn from each table and specify a certain part of that column relating to one of the tables.

<h1>
data scientists
</h1>

<p>
A data scientist, in relation to a computer scientist, works more with numbers and their presentation rather than information in words. A data scientist attempts to present data and manipulate data in order to make data more easily accessed and visable. With sql, a data scientst can specfy what is being seen by the user based on a click. A data scientist will write code in order to present numerical values in a way that suggests different statistical conclusions and trends. A computer scientist does this with information other that statistical numbers in tables. WIth a given excel file, a data scientist can manipulate and present the data in any way by grabbing certain parts of the data and using scales to make that data seem a certain way. Data scientists can also hide a trend in the data by highlighting more so another trnd in the data. Functinos can also be done on tables to relate different sets of data to eachother and develope trends in this way.
